# Numerical Methods for Differential Equations
The aim of this project is to showcase computational methods for solving both ordinary and partial differential equations. 
This includes the construction, application and analysis of basic computational algorithms for approximate solutions on 
a computer of initial value, boundary value and eigenvalue problems for ordinary differential equations, and for partial 
differential equations in one space and one time dimension.
